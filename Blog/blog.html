      		<p class="blockquote color1">"Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power. Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women' s strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman." 
      		<br>Marston</p>
      		<li>Wonder Woman was created for young girls to understand being independent is cool</li>
